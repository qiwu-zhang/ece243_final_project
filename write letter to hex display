/* For this question you are to write an assembly-language program for the ARM processor. 
Theprogram[10 marks] should perform the following task: in an inﬁnite loop read from
the SW port (address 0xFF200040). If the value read from SW is 0, 1, 2, or 3 then you
should display the characters ’g’, ’o’, ’o’, and ’d’, respectively, on the HEX0 
display (address 0xFF200020). You should error-check the value read from the SW
port; if it is greater than 3 then you should display a ’-’ on HEX0. 
Forthe7-segmentdisplayrecallthatsegment 0 is at thetop and then the segments are 
orderedfrom 1 to 5 in the clockwise direction, with segment 6 in the middle.
